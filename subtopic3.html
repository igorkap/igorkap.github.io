Computers for Learning program website is designed to give computers to
schools in need of technology in education.&nbsp; It explains the
rules, regulations, and eligibility requirements for the CFL
program.&nbsp; The CFL program is a non-profit organization, and only
gives computers to schools promising to use them for the sole purpose
of education.&nbsp; It lists the countries that are eligible to
participate and gives useful links to the frequently asked questions
regarding the program, the types of educational institutions that
participate, and also how to choose the equipment to meet that
particular school's needs.&nbsp; <br>

is also another site designed to give computers to schools who are in
need of them.&nbsp; This website, however, is much different from the
other one because it is not designed only for educational
institutions.&nbsp; It is also for regular people who want to help
donate computers for education.&nbsp; It gives links for people who
wish to donate their old computers to students in need, and also for
students and schools wishing to recieve a donated computer.&nbsp; It
also provides information for why it is necessary to have technology in
education.&nbsp; It talks about curriculum enhancement for students and
the useful tools for teaching.&nbsp; It also provides links to free
software programs such as the Ziff-Davis Software Library which offers
thousands of free downloads of popular programs.<br>
